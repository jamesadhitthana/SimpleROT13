# Easy and Simple ROT13
![ROT13 James Adhitthana Cover](http://blog.jamesgalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ROT13-Cover.jpg)

ROT13 is the simplest and easiest way to encrypt and decrypt (cipher) a string of text! On this java application I have created a very simple java app to encrypt/decrypt a string of text using ROT13. ROT13 is basically another substitution cipher technique (part of the Caesar cipher) that replaces a letter with the thirteenth letter after it (ROT13 = "rotate by 13 places").

## Getting Started

Just download the java file and then run it on your computer. I have commented the code and so you can just view my comments to understand how the code works. It is so easy that beginner programmers should be able to understand it.
Enjoy!


### Instructions

1. Run the .java file and follow the instruction on the console
```
Input string to encrypt/decrypt then press enter: 
```
2. Type the string to encrypt/decrypt on the console
```
Input string to encrypt/decrypt then press enter: This is a secret text!
```
3. Press enter to process the text
4. View the results!
```
Input string to encrypt/decrypt then press enter: This is a secret text!
---
String Before:
This is a secret text!
---
String After:
Guvf vf n frperg grkg!
