# Easy and Simple ROT13
ROT13 is the simplest and easiest way to encrypt and decrypt (cipher) a string of text! On this java application I have created a very simple way to encrypt/decrypt a string of text using ROT13. ROT13 is basically another substitution cipher technique (part of the Caesar cipher) that replaces a letter with the thirteenth letter after it (ROT13 = "rotate by 13 places").


## Getting Started

Just download the java file and then run it on your computer. I have commented the code and so you can just view my comments to understand how the code works.
Enjoy!


### Instructions

1. Run the .java file and follow the instruction on the console
```
Input string to encrypt/decrypt then press enter: 
```
2. Type the string to encrypt/decrypt on the console
```
Input string to encrypt/decrypt then press enter: This is a secret text!
```
3. Press enter
4. View the results!
```
Input string to encrypt/decrypt then press enter: This is a secret text!
---
String Before:
This is a secret text!
---
String After:
Guvf vf n frperg grkg!

```
